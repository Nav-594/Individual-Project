# Individual project - Artivia
This is my submission for the CS3010 Final Year Project (Dissertation) at Aston University.
Artivia is a multiplayer party game made using Phaser 3. Artivia is a ‘Draw and Guess’ game where one person is selected as the designated drawer and the rest have to decipher the drawing and guess what it is.
