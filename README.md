* **Server-side Development:** Implementing backend functionalities with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
* **Usability Testing:** Conducting user testing to gather feedback and identify areas for improvement.

**Current functionalities:**

* Room creation and joining
* Multiplayer drawing functionality
* Chat box for in-game communication

**Future improvements:**
